    "text": "I am an Associate Teaching Professor of Economics at the University of Washington, in Seattle, WA. I study the health and economic impacts of health and nutrition policy.\nMy current work focuses on nutrition policy, with evaluations of Seattle’s Fresh Bucks healthy food subsidy, Universal Free School Meals, and sweetened beverage taxes. But I am also interested in topics ranging from firm behavioral responses to policy to pedagogical innovations in Economics classrooms.\nMy work is quantitative and focuses on causal identification of policy impacts using survey and administrative data. I enjoy working with interdisciplinary teams to obtain broader insight into policy implementation and to conduct research that is community-engaged and policy-relevant.\nMy Ph.D. is from UC Berkeley Economics, where I specialized in Economic Development and Industrial Organization, and held a fellowship in Demography. I teach microeconomic theory (from intro to advanced) and the economics of population and economic development.\nYou can contact me at knoxm at uw dot edu or at my mailing address: University of Washington Department of Economics, Box 353330, Seattle, WA 98195-3330."

    "text": "This page is meant to provide resources for students and to answer frequently asked questions. You can navigate the page with the links above. Would you like to see more resources here? Email me!\n\nRecommendation Letter Requests\n\nIf you are considering requesting that I write you a recommendation letter, please read the guidelines for letter requests below.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\n\nYou took a class (or two) from me and performed in the top 10% of your class (~3.7 grade).\n\nIt’s additionally helpful if you spent time in my office hours discussing anything other than your recommendation letter.\nYou exhibited integrity, motivation, and maturity in my class, or\n\n\n\n\nYou did an independent study or honors thesis with me, or\n\n\n\nYou worked for me or got to know me well in some other capacity.\n\n\n\nRequesting a Letter\n\nIf you meet one of the requirements above, please send me an email with your request (and telling me how you meet the criteria above) before October 1. I will let you know by October 15, once I have a sense of how many requests I have received.\nWhether or not I am able to write you a letter, good luck with the application process!\n\n\n\nData Resources for Students\n\n\nEcon 448\nStudents in Econ 448 typically use data from The Human Mortality Database and IPUMS International. These are both wonderful sources of data for demographic and household-level studies. Students in Econ 448 are required to make a free account at these websites and agree to all rules and restrictions surrounding the use of the data. Please see class GitHub repository for more information about joining the IPUMS class account and data analysis.\n\n\nOther Sources for International/Household Data Projects\nIPUMS- Census and survey data from around the world. Includes access to the Demographic and Health Surveys from the DHS Program. Various levels of approval required, depending on the dataset.\nWorldbank Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS) - Household surveys in many countries and many years.\nIHME Global Health Data - Comprehensive health data (surveys and vital statistics for many countries).\nIMF Data Library - Time series data on economic indicators (good source of macro data sets)\nICPSR - University of Michigan data repository with a variety of data sources. Your UW email should get you access, but you will need to get approved.\nUW Databases - Includes Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) with good background data on most countries. Note: Need UW login to access.\n\n\nData Analysis Tips\nI am mainly a Stata user, but I make students in Econ 448 learn and use R. Why? Well, it’s free, it’s more flexible than Stata, it’s more widely used than Stata, and it integrates well with other programs you might want to use like Python or SQL. Need more reasons to learn R?\nHowever, R and Stata are just tools. In order to use them to produce the output you desire, I highly recommend that you focus on two things:\n\nThe structure of your data, both how it is arranged and how you are storing it/importing it into your statistical program. Understanding R packages like tidyr is a great place to start, but you will probably also need some basic understanding of linear algebra to ensure that you process your data correctly.\nThe source of your data, including the codebook, data dictionary, and any survey questions (if you have access). This includes understanding how survey respondents (or whatever entity forms the primary unit of analysis in your data) were chosen.Once you understand these things about your data, figuring out the correct syntax and programming steps is often just a matter of consulting resources like stack exchange. However, if you don’t understand them, it’s pretty hard to trust your results!"
