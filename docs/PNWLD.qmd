We are currently accepting submissions for the

**8th Annual Pacific Northwest Labor Day Workshop**

Friday, September 19, 2025

Seattle, WA

Please email your submission to pnwldorganize\@gmail.com by Sunday, August 17, or reach out to me with any questions!

Submissions should be related to either the topics or the methods of labor economics. While abstracts and extended abstracts are both welcome, a slight preference will be given to full working papers that still need significant work and would benefit from the workshop format.  Graduate students going on the job market in 2025-26 are encouraged to apply.
