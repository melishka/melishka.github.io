permalink: http://melishka.github.io/files/2013_sp_and_employment_campos_knox.pdf
excerpt: 'We analyze the effect of Seguro Popular on employment across Mexico using 33 large and relatively rich cities from labor force surveys conducted from 2001 to 2004. In order to measure the effect for poorer municipalities, we also use the individual-level Oportunidades dataset that covers 136 municipalities from 2002 to 2004. We find little evidence of any correlation between
Seguro Popular and the decision of workers to be employed in the formal or informal sector.'
