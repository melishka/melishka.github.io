Econ 448 is an undergraduate cours that covers economic theories of fertility, marriage, intra-household decision making, gender discrimination, and migration, with real-world applications to the process of economic development.  It fulfills the university's diversity and writing credit requirements.

I typically teach it twice a year.  Full syllabus and reading list available on request.

Course Description
======
This course is designed to introduce students to the subject of international economic development, with a focus on population issues.  Since I am an economist, we will be focusing on the topics and tools of economics, and the body of knowledge so far, as created by economists.  Topics include demography, poverty and income inequality, fertility choice, sex selection, marriage choice and the role of women, parental investments in child health and education, including discrimination against girls, and migration and urbanization. 

The goals of the course are as follows: 1) Students should be able to identify and discuss the issues surrounding the topics listed above; 2) Students should be able to analyze economic models relevant to these issues; and 3) Students should be able to comment on magazine articles and review articles in economic journals dealing with population and development, explaining and expanding upon the economic analysis they contain.
