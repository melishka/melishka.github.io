Econ 200 is the first course in the economics sequence at the University of Washington.  We cover consumer theory (preferences, demand) and producer theory (prouction, firm costs, profit maximization, supply curves, perfectly competitve markets, imperfect competition), and the economic consequences of market failure and government intervention (externalities, price controls, taxes and subsidies, efficiency and deadweight loss).  

The text is Karlan and Morduch.

What is Economics?
======
Economics is the study of how humans make choices under constraints. Those constraints are typically due to scarcity or tradeoffs, and usually take the form of budgets, prices, or in-put costs. In this class, we study the choices made by individuals and firms (thatâ€™s the micro in microeconomics).
