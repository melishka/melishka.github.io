Econ 400 is a course in advance microeconomic theory that covers consumer and producer theory, uncertainty, and nash equilibrium.  I teach using multivariate calculus, and students are responsible for derivations of key concepts.  The text is Nicholson and Snyder.

I typically teach Econ 400 twice a year and have been teaching it since 2012.

Course Description
======

This course presents the conceptual foundations and analytical methods of microeconomics. It covers the basic theories of consumer and firm 
behavior, perfect competition, imperfect competition (monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition), and decisions under uncertainty.
