I regularly teach four classes in the Department of Economics at the University of Washington:

## Introduction to Microeconomics (Econ 200)  
   Econ 200 is the first course in the economics sequence at the University of Washington. We cover consumer theory (preferences, demand) and producer theory (prouction, firm costs, profit maximization, supply curves, perfectly competitve markets, imperfect competition), and the economic consequences of market failure and government intervention (externalities, price controls, taxes and subsidies, efficiency and deadweight loss).  

   The text is Karlan and Morduch.

## Microeconomic Theory (Econ 400)  
   Econ 400 presents the conceptual foundations and analytical methods of microeconomics. It covers the basic theories of consumer and firm behavior, perfect competition, imperfect competition (monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition), and decisions under uncertainty.  
   
   The text is Nicholson and Snyder.

## Population and Development (Econ 448)  
   Econ 448 is an undergraduate cours that covers economic theories of fertility, marriage, intra-household decision making, gender discrimination, and migration, with real-world applications to the process of economic development. It fulfills the universityâ€™s diversity and writing credit requirements.  
   
   There is no text.  Students read selected journal articles, book chapters, and popular press pieces.

## Teaching Introductory Economics (Econ 602)   
   Econ 602 is a graduate course for first year graduate students.  It teaches the basics of course design and planning for first time teachers of introductory classes in Economics.
