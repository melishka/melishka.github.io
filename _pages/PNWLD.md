We are currently soliciting submissions for the 6th Annual Pacific Northwest Labor Day Workshop to be held on Friday, September 15, 2023, at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA.  Submissions should be related to either the topics or the methods of labor economics. While abstracts and extended abstracts are both welcome, a slight preference will be given to full working papers that still need significant work and would benefit from the workshop format.  Graduate students going on the job market in 2023-24 are encouraged to apply.  
 
Please send submissions  to pnwldorganize@gmail.com. Questions can be directed to knoxm@uw.edu or Paul.Thompson@oregonstate.edu. The deadline for submissions is 11:59 pm on Sunday, July 30th and decisions will be made in early/mid August.
