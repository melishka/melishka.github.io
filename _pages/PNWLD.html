Pacific Northwest Labor Day (PNWLD) is a workshop organized by Melissa Knox (UW) and Paul Thompson (OSU) (and formerly
by Jamein Cunningham, now of U of Memphis).  The workshop's purpose is to share and support labor economics research in the Pacific 
Northwest.  The workshop is also an opportunity to get to know other researchers in the area, promote collaboration, and develop support
and feedback networks. All labor economists, or economists who use the methodology of labor economics, are invited to attend.  

The workshop is typically held in September.  Please check back in early summer for details about the 2020 workshop.
