### Recommendation Letter Guidelines
-------
If you are considering requesting that I write you a recommendation letter, please read the guidelines for letter requests below.  


#### Minimum Requirements
-------
* You took a class (or two) from me and performed in the top 10% of your class (~3.7 grade).  
  * It's additionally helpful if you spent time in my office hours discussing anything other than your recommendation letter.
* You did an independent study, honors thesis, or internship with me.
* You worked for me or got to know me well in some other capacity.

#### Requesting a Letter
-------
If you meet these minimum requirements, please fill out the google form linked below no later than **October 15th** of the academic year
you are planning to apply.  I will notify you of my decision by **October 31st**.

[look for this form in Summer 2020]

Whether or not I am able to write you a letter, good luck with the application process!
