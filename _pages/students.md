### Courses and Syllabi
I typically teach three courses, Introduction to Microeconomics (Econ 200), Advanced Microeconomic Theory (Econ 400), and Population and Development (Econ 448).

The most current version of my coure syllabi can always be found here: 
[UW Econ Syllabi](https://econ.washington.edu/undergraduate-course-syllabi)

-----------------------------------------------

### Recommendation Letter Requests
-------
If you are considering requesting that I write you a recommendation letter, please read the guidelines for letter requests below.  


#### Minimum Requirements
-------
* You took a class (or two) from me and performed in the top 10% of your class (~3.7 grade).  
  * It's additionally helpful if you spent time in my office hours discussing anything other than your recommendation letter.
* You did an independent study, honors thesis, or internship with me.
* You worked for me or got to know me well in some other capacity.

#### Requesting a Letter
-------
If you meet these minimum requirements, please fill out the google form linked below no later than **October 1st** of the academic year
you are planning to apply.  I will notify you of my decision by **October 31st**.

[Letter Request Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfm8Uyowt6aOldgH53cr7M-dHxaOuDQZWOPuMbbntiGoC9agw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Whether or not I am able to write you a letter, good luck with the application process!  

### Data Sources for Students
--------------
Students in Econ 448 typically use data from [The Human Mortality Database](mortality.org) and [IPUMS International](ipums.org/internationa(https://international.ipums.org/international/). These are both wonderful sources of data for demographic and household-level studies. Students in Econ 448 are required to make a free account at these websites and agree to all rules and restrictions surrounding the use of the data. Please see [class GitHub repository](https://github.com/melishka/Econ_448_DevoPop) for more information about joining the IPUMS class account and data analysis. 

#### Other Sources of Economic Data for International/Household Data Projects
IPUMS - Census and survey data from around the world. Includes access to the Demographic and Health Surveys from the DHS Program. 

Worldbank Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS) – link – Household surveys in many countries and many years

IMF Data Library: Time series data on economic indicators (good source of macro data sets)

Economist Intelligence Unit (UW only): Good background data on most countries

#### Data Analysis Tips
-----------------
I am mainly a Stata user, but I make students in Econ 448 learn and use R. Why? Well, it's free, it's more flexible than Stata, it's more widely used than Stata, and it integrates well with other programs you might want to use like Python or SQL. 

[Need more reasons to learn R?](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2014/03/why-use-r-five-reasons)

However, R and Stata are just tools. In order to use them to produce the output you desire, I highly recommend that you focus on two things:
1. The structure of your data, both how it is arranged and how you are storing it /importing it into your statistical program. Understanding R packages like [tidyr](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) is a great place to start, but you will probably also need some basic understanding of linear algebra to ensure that you process your data correctly.
2. The source of your data, including the codebook, data dictionary, and any survey questions (if you have access). This includes understanding how survey respondents (or whatever entity forms the primary unit of analysis in your data) were chosen.

Once you understand these things about your data, figuring out the correct syntax and programming steps is often just a matter of consulting resources like stack exchange. Howevere, if you don't understand them, it's pretty hard to trust your results!
