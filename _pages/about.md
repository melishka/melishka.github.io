Welcome to Dr. Knox's home on the web.  I am an economist at the University of Washington with a focus in health economics.  My main research is in the ways that households respond to changes in health policy and health care reform in Mexico and Seattle, but my interests vary widely, from individual fertility decisions to the behavioral responses of firms to policy.  My Ph.D. is from UC Berkeley Economics, where I specialized in Economic Development and Industrial Organization, and held a fellowship in Demography.  I teach microeconomic theory (from intro to advanced) and the economics of population and development.    

Current Projects

Seattle’s Sweetened Beverage Tax:

I am currently working on several research projects related to the evaluation of Seattle’s Sweetened Beverage Tax.  Our projects are funded by the City of Seattle, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Kaiser Permanente, and CSDE at UW.

Our reports to the City of Seattle can be found here:

Baseline Report

Six Month Post-Tax Report

Food Availability Report

I also completed an independent report on the impact of beverage tax spending on the WA farm economy (with Lina Pinero Walkinshaw):

Mexican Health Care System:

I continue to work on the Mexican health care system, specifically the Seguro Popular reform.  I have two completed working papers listed above.  The next projects will derive from the pilot research below:

Selection, Moral Hazard, and Demand for Preventive Care under Universal Health Care
(project funded by CHTF Pilot Grant for Research on Subnational Burden of Disease – NIA Grant number P30AG047845)
