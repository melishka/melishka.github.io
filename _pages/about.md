I am an economist at the University of Washington with a focus in health economics.  My main research is in the ways that households respond to changes in health policy and health care reform in Mexico and Seattle, but my interests vary widely, from individual fertility decisions to the behavioral responses of firms to policy.  My Ph.D. is from UC Berkeley Economics, where I specialized in Economic Development and Industrial Organization, and held a fellowship in Demography.  I teach microeconomic theory (from intro to advanced) and the economics of population and development.   

<b><i>Current Projects</i></b>

<b>Seattle’s Sweetened Beverage Tax:</b>

I am currently working on several research projects related to the evaluation of Seattle’s Sweetened Beverage Tax.  Our projects are funded by the City of Seattle, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Kaiser Permanente, and CSDE at UW.

I am the first author on two working papers on this topic.  Drafts available on request.  

1. Is the Public Sweet on Sugary Beverages? Social Desirability Bias and Sweetened Beverage Taxes (with Vanessa Oddo, Jessica Jones-      Smith, and Lina Pinero Walkinshaw) (revise and resubmit)

2. Strategic Firm Responses to Sin Taxes and Tax Pass-Through: Evidence from Seattle’s Sweetened Beverage Tax (with Jessica Jones-Smith, Lina Pinero Walkinshaw, and Vanessa Oddo)

<b>Our reports to the City of Seattle can be found here:</b>

Baseline Report<br>
Six Month Post-Tax Report<br>
Food Availability Report<br>
I also completed an independent report on the impact of beverage tax spending on the WA farm economy (with Lina Pinero Walkinshaw)<br>

<b>Mexican Health Care System:</b>

I continue to work on the Mexican health care system, specifically the Seguro Popular reform.  I have two completed working papers that are hopefully making their way to publication soon.  Drafts available on request.

1. Social Safety Net Programs and the Flow of Return Migrants: Evidence from the Public Provision of Health Insurance in Mexico (with Jaime Lara, Universidad de Monterrey) (submitted)

2. Health Care Reform - Transfer Program or Something More?  Evidence from Mexico’s Seguro Popular Program (revise and resubmit)

The next projects will derive from the pilot research below:
Selection, Moral Hazard, and Demand for Preventive Care under Universal Health Care
(project funded by CHTF Pilot Grant for Research on Subnational Burden of Disease – NIA Grant number P30AG047845)
