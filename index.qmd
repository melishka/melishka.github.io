I am an Associate Teaching Professor of Economics at the University of Washington, in Seattle, WA. I study the health and economic impacts of health and nutrition policy.

My current work focuses on nutrition policy, with evaluations of Seattle's Fresh Bucks healthy food subsidy, Universal Free School Meals, and sweetened beverage taxes. But I am also interested in topics ranging from firm behavioral responses to policy to pedagogical innovations in Economics classrooms.

My work is quantitative and focuses on causal identification of policy impacts using survey and administrative data. I enjoy working with interdisciplinary teams to obtain broader insight into policy implementation and to conduct research that is community-engaged and policy-relevant.

My Ph.D. is from UC Berkeley Economics, where I specialized in Economic Development and Industrial Organization, and held a fellowship in Demography. I teach microeconomic theory (from intro to advanced) and the economics of population and economic development.
